## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4F46E5) to convey professionalism and focus. Indigo evokes feelings of reliability which will give the users a sense of trust when using the product. It stands out in the UI and provides a solid base for contrast.
- Background color: Light Grey (#F9FAFB), almost white, to provide a clean, modern backdrop. It provides enough contrast to make the main content pop without being distracting.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#A78BFA), an analogous color to the primary Indigo, to add a touch of elegance and highlight interactive elements. Its lighter tone contrasts well, making buttons and interactive elements noticeable.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for readability and a professional look.
- Use of glass morphism effects (bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md) to give depth and a modern feel.
- Subtle animations with 200-300ms transitions for smooth user interactions.
- Consistent and minimalist icons to represent task categories and status.
