# Taskify Pro - Accessibility Guidelines

## Accessibility Principles

Taskify Pro is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users, including those with disabilities. We follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards and aim to ensure our application is:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation
- [x] Skip link implemented to bypass navigation and go directly to main content
- [x] Logical tab order throughout the application
- [x] Focus indicators for all interactive elements
- [x] No keyboard traps in any component

### Screen Reader Support
- [x] Semantic HTML structure with appropriate landmarks
- [x] Proper heading hierarchy
- [x] Alt text for all images and icons
- [x] ARIA labels for interactive elements without visible text

### Motion and Animation
- [x] Reduced motion support via `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- [x] Custom `useReducedMotion` hook for consistent implementation
- [x] Alternative static states for animated components

### Color and Contrast
- [x] Color is not used as the only means of conveying information
- [x] Text has sufficient contrast against background colors
- [x] Focus indicators have sufficient contrast
- [x] Multiple theme options for different visual preferences

### Forms and Inputs
- [x] Form inputs have associated labels
- [x] Error messages are programmatically associated with inputs
- [x] Required fields are clearly indicated
- [x] Form validation provides clear feedback

## Accessibility Checklist for New Features

When implementing new features, ensure they meet the following criteria:

### Keyboard Accessibility
- [ ] All functionality is operable through a keyboard
- [ ] Focus order is logical and intuitive
- [ ] Focus is visible at all times
- [ ] Custom keyboard shortcuts are documented and do not conflict with browser or screen reader shortcuts

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- [ ] All content has appropriate text alternatives
- [ ] Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers
- [ ] ARIA attributes are used correctly and only when necessary
- [ ] Live regions are used for important updates

### Visual Design
- [ ] Text meets minimum contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] UI components have sufficient contrast against their backgrounds
- [ ] Information is not conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Content is readable and functional when zoomed to 200%

### Interaction Design
- [ ] Sufficient time is provided to read and use content
- [ ] Users can control time-sensitive content
- [ ] Motion animation can be disabled
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels

### Forms and Inputs
- [ ] All form controls have associated labels
- [ ] Error messages are clear and specific
- [ ] Form validation is accessible and provides clear guidance
- [ ] Required fields are clearly indicated

## Testing Procedures

### Automated Testing
- Run axe or similar accessibility audit tools
- Validate HTML to ensure proper structure
- Check color contrast with tools like Contrast Checker

### Manual Testing
- Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)
- Test with different display settings (zoom, high contrast)
- Test with reduced motion settings enabled

## Implemented Components and Patterns

### Skip Link
```tsx
<a 
  href="#main-content" 
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:z-50 focus:p-4 focus:bg-background focus:text-foreground focus:border focus:border-primary"
>
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

### Reduced Motion Hook
```tsx
export function useReducedMotion(): boolean {
  const [prefersReducedMotion, setPrefersReducedMotion] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window === 'undefined') return;
    
    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
    setPrefersReducedMotion(mediaQuery.matches);
    
    const handleChange = (event: MediaQueryListEvent) => {
      setPrefersReducedMotion(event.matches);
    };
    
    mediaQuery.addEventListener('change', handleChange);
    return () => {
      mediaQuery.removeEventListener('change', handleChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return prefersReducedMotion;
}
```

### Animation with Reduced Motion Support
```tsx
<div className={cn(
  getAnimationClasses(
    "animate-bounce", // Standard animation
    "transform-none", // Reduced motion alternative
    prefersReducedMotion
  )
)} />
```

### Error Boundary for Graceful Error Handling
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>
  <ComponentThatMightError />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Future Accessibility Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- [ ] Enhance focus management for modals and dialogs
- [ ] Improve screen reader announcements for state changes
- [ ] Add more comprehensive keyboard shortcuts

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement focus trapping in modal dialogs
- [ ] Add high contrast mode
- [ ] Improve form validation feedback
- [ ] Enhance touch target sizes for mobile

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add voice control support
- [ ] Implement advanced screen reader announcements
- [ ] Add internationalization support
- [ ] Create accessibility documentation for users
