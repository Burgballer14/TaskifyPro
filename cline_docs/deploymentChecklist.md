## Deployment Strategy

### Vercel Deployment
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `.next`
4. Set environment variables if needed
5. Deploy to production

### Manual Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Test the build locally with `npm start`
3. Deploy the built application to hosting provider
4. Verify the deployment works correctly

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues after deployment:

1. Identify the issue and its severity
2. If severe, roll back to the previous stable version
3. If minor, fix the issue and deploy a patch
4. Document the issue and solution for future reference

## Future Enhancements

Features to consider for future releases:

1. User authentication and profiles
2. Backend integration for data persistence
3. Offline support with service workers
4. Push notifications for task reminders
5. Mobile app versions
6. Advanced analytics and reporting
7. Team collaboration features
